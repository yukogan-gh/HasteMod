# HasteMod
A client-side mod that abuses the instamine feature to very quickly mine set types of blocks.

# Default controls
- U: Toggle mod on/of
- X: Activate/use block breaker (when instamine is possible)
- Y: Toggle Block Selection Mode
> Note: make sure no keybinds are overlapping

# How to use
When enabled, mine one instamineable block of choice to select it as the target block. When activating (the X key), the mod will try to instantly break all blocks in player (= 4 blocks) reach.
This can be really useful when e.g.: mining for stone, andesite, sand, ...
